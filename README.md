# Inkwell
Inkwell is a series of Datapacks for Minecraft 1.16.4.
It features (At the time of writing) 2 custom mechanics for use in map maker's own maps, given I am credited.

These modules are:
Core - Required for use of any module. Provides base utility for other modules to use.
Custom Enchants - Currently barebones version for Project Starship, and not fully supported.
Guns - Adds a way to shoot any item with durability that isn't armor.
Riptide Attack - Adds a forced offhand trident with a built-in cooldown.
Simply drag any combination of these packs (Always including Core!) into your datapack folder for your Minecraft world, then /reload.

This is heavily inspired (And helped made by) PearUhDox and his series Cartographer:
