Changelog for the current Beta of Inkwell:

- Refactored custom damage.
There is now an option on whether or not the custom damage system will spoof the damage tick via a wither tick.
This can be toggled by performing this command alongside the damage call:
"scoreboard players set $SimDamageTick InkW_Temp 1" 1 for spoofing, 0 for not.
Always set to desired value for safety, lest it used the last value set.
